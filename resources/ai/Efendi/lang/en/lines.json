  "taunt_2"      : "I have nothing against you - save for the fact that you are standing in my way.",
  "taunt_3"      : "It's rather easy: You are annoying. And I am bored. So: let's fight!",
  "taunt_4"      : "I may be old and frail - but ho! I do grant myself a battle or so from time to time. *crazy chuckle*",
  "anger_1"      : "I might have been rather hasty. Well, I will reconsider my battle plan. See you! *laughter*",
  "anger_2"      : "You are lashing out. You remind me of an angry child! No true commander would conduct war in THIS way.",

  "nervous_1"    : "I have already fought battles that seemed more condemned than this one! Do not believe I will surrender!",
  "nervous_2"    : "The current situation does tend to be a little unsettling...",
  "victory_1"    : "You are too imprudent. You will not be triumphant! Heed my advice and forsake these countries.",
  "victory_2"    : "Have I aroused your anger? You are too imprudent! Just like all the other commanders of your countries!",
  "victory_3"    : "Wisdom of old age is triumphant over hot-tempered youth! Yet again! You may return when you have learned.",
  "victory_4"    : "Is there such a thing? I am even better than I believed! Hahaha-haa! How delightful!",
  "request"      : "Many things in life are more beautiful than gold. But sometimes - we cannot reach those aims without gold... *laughter*",

  "ally_death"   : "I had nothing to oppose my enemies' wrath... Heed my death as a warning! You will be the next one! *crazy chuckle*",
  "congrats"     : "Hailing the death of so many is a sad occasion for celebration - but an occasion nevertheless! *crazy chuckle*",
  "boast"        : "Hooray! My plans are doing well! What about you?",
  "help"         : "Hm! Our enemies always catch me on the wrong foot! Hurry and come to my rescue fast, or this flaw will have been my last one... *crazy chuckle*",

  "team_winning" : "Splendid! My experience and your will to combat! *chuckle* Coincidence of opposites, that's how we get the most of it!",
  "team_losing"  : "Our enemies' schemes are proceeding. You are slow coaches, though, don't you think?",
  "help_sent"    : "Of course, some of my soldiers will come to your defence! But take into account sending them back when they have fulfilled their task!",
