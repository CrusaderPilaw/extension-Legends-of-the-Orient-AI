  "description"  : "The Emira is a generous woman and smart leader and her people worship her. Both her economy and proficiencies in battle make her to be a strong ally - or a fierce opponent!",

  "unknown_1"    : "(Emira)",
  "taunt_1"      : "To this day I will free these lands from superstition and tyranny and head for a brighter future than you may fathom!",
  "taunt_2"      : "I did not wish for this war. But as long as you linger in these lands my people will not be safe! I will do what has to be done!",
  "taunt_3"      : "Time has come. This war must be concluded, once and for all! Be prepared!",
  "taunt_4"      : "How exactly do you seek a resolution to this battle? Entrench yourself behind your walls? Or are you bold enough to face me on the battlefield?",
  "anger_1"      : "Well done - yours is the victory. But that simply implies that I am going to double my efforts!",
  "anger_2"      : "Venting your wrath on my people over YOUR military impotence is but proof of your flaw in character.",
  "plead"        : "I perceive when I am defeated. Execute me; I accept my destiny. But I have one plea: Spare my people!",
  "nervous_1"    : "One day my will to defend this people may die. The hour of the wolf, when my realm thunderously falls, may have come closer - although this day is still far off! Because I will fight! This day!",
  "nervous_2"    : "I have vowed to protect my people. And I will fight to the last moment to fulfill my oath!",
  "victory_1"    : "Your men fought well, albeit the outcome was disappointing; I will return those I have captured.",
  "victory_2"    : "As I expected: You do not bestow your farmers and servants any attention. So your lands are without protection - a weakness that I will make the most of.",
  "victory_3"    : "Don't trouble yourself. You have fought well. But you are not the first man to underestimate me... your crown will be included in my collection.",
  "victory_4"    : "I have taken the matters to my own hands - another enemy succumbs to my forces!",
  "request"      : "I'm in desperate need of more supplies! Could you help me out?",
  "thanks"       : "Accept my appreciation. I will make sure that these supplies will only be used for our cause!",
  "ally_death"   : "My desire is neither ovation nor song. My request is but simple: Accomplish our quests!",
  "congrats"     : "Well done, trusty friend! Your victory brings peace a fine step forward. The peace that these countries are yearning for!",
  "boast"        : "One of our foes has been crushed! Soon there will be an end to this conflict and my people can live once again in peace.",

  "no_attack_1"  : "I only fight if necessary. And your thirst for glory is no such necessity!",
  "no_attack_2"  : "Recent battles have proved difficult for the temper of my people. Well - no; for the time being I will not stand by your side.",
  "no_help_1"    : "It pains me that I must decline your request, but my troops are already fully engaged. So please understand; bowing to the welfare of my own people is my supreme law.",
  "no_help_2"    : "Please forgive me. But I must replenish the ranks of my own armed forces before I have men to spare.",
  "no_sent"      : "You should teach yourself how to wrest necessary ore and fruit from these lands. I cannot be of help in this situation.",
  "sent"         : "This country is neither wealthy nor benign. But you are in luck: I am both.",
  "team_winning" : "Trust and strenght are the foundations of our alliance. Our enemies are already backing away!",
  "team_losing"  : "Things aren't looking too satisfactory. But do not abandon hope! Reinforce your efforts and we will be victorious here!",
  "help_sent"    : "My men will take care of you.",
