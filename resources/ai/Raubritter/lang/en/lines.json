  "anger_1"      : "Today's triumph is without significance for this cause. Other means I know of will lead us to victory!",
  "anger_2"      : "You are well advised to display your malice. After all, VILLAINS are essential to knights - when they become HEROES!",
  "plead"        : "It gives me pain that I could not turn the tables. Such a cruel world, in which heroes succumb to evildoers!",
